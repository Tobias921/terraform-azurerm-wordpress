## Overview
The main Terraform template (main.tf) is broken up into easy to read and modify sections and is very configurable via custom parameters that are well documented. You can deploy this template without changing any parameters but will be promped for database server password and wordpress password.
There is also a terraform variables file (dev.tfvars) included in the repository which you can change the values to suit your deployment. Please remember to **NOT** store usernames or passwords in this file. The variables file should be self expanatory as the parameters are names in accordance with their purpose.

## How to deploy
Firstly, modify the variable file (dev.tfvars) with the parameter input values for your environment, its accepted practice to have a variables file per environment/deployment as needed.

From there run the following commands:

* **tf init** - To download and initialize the Terraform providers locally.
* **tf plan -var-file='dev.tfvars'** - To show changes required by the current configuration, passing in the file 'dev.tfvars' as input. You will be prompted for passwords for the MySQL and Wordpress installations.
* **tf apply -var-file='dev.tfvars'** - To deploy the infrastructure, passing in the file 'dev.tfvars' as input. You will be prompted for passwords for the MySQL and Wordpress installations. Once you have checked the deployment - Confirm creation by entering 'Yes'.
* **tf destroy -var-file='dev.tfvars'** - To destroy previously-created infrastructure. You will be prompted for passwords for the MySQL and Wordpress installations. Once you have checked the deployment - Confirm destruction by entering 'Yes'.
